HOW TO USE API

(idk not now, for now just some routes for local use will do)

GET localhost/api/classrooms -> will show all classrooms
GET localhost/api/classrooms/{id} -> will show classroom with that id
POST localhost/api/classrooms -> will add a product, accepted input = title(string)
PUT / PATCH localhost/api/classrooms/{id} -> will update the details of the classroom with that id
DELETE localhost/api/classrooms/{id} -> will delete classroom with that id
